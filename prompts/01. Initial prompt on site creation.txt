analyze files thoroughly and make the website as close to the design presented in Dianych_v1.pdf as possible. Guidlines which button leads where presented in Site_mechanics
Use img assets in the places visually matches by images

Make site responsive and working on different screen sizes. Pixel-perfect is not a priority, but don't deviate much from the design. Follow the latest js and css trends , maybe use next.js, but it is up to you.

images in the sections Брошки (brooches) are actually should be in gallery with user poissibility to scroll and see more pictures (all in the folder brooches)
Same situations with Вишивка на одязі (clothes)
Панно (painted_panel)
and Рамки (frames)

Pdf has significant gaps, ignore them, it is a design flaw.
